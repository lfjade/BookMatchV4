## ❤️ **ABOUT** ❤️
The BookMatch represents my first real steps into understanding SoC, DRY, and clean code. This project is very dear to my heart. When it first came to life, I was just beginning my journey in programming. I had only recently been introduced to JavaScript, and TypeScript was still something new and intimidating. It's first version was full of bugs, and me and my team couldn't even present it properly because most of the methods broke at presentation time. That led me to the deep wish of actually making it right.
As it grew, I got to learn why there are good practices and bad practices in coding.
This is not just my personal project, as it is track of my swet and blood in the path of becoming a dev.
Trying to make it work the way that I first envisioned it gave me a nice bunch of opportunities on overcoming the knowledge I had and how much I believed myself.
Maybe it's not the best project you have ever seen, but surely is best then I tought I could do back then. And still I'm very proud at the result.
